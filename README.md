# Senior Full-Stack Engineer
**Laravel Backend | Flutter Mobile | Production Systems at Scale**

I build production-grade systems that handle real transactions, real users, and real business operations. My work focuses on scalable backend architecture, multi-platform mobile applications, and the critical infrastructure that keeps businesses running.

## Technical Expertise

**Backend Engineering (Laravel/PHP)**
- Complex approval workflow systems with multi-level authorization
- Multi-tenant database architecture with dynamic connection management
- Transaction-heavy financial systems with audit trails and reconciliation
- RESTful API design with optimized query patterns and eager loading
- Real-time notification systems using Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Payment gateway integrations with transaction verification and retry logic
- Role-based access control with granular route permissions
- Database schema design with proper indexing, foreign keys, and soft deletes

**Mobile Engineering (Flutter/Dart)**
- Production apps serving thousands of active users
- State management with Riverpod for complex business logic
- Multi-platform development (iOS, Android, Web considerations)
- WebView integrations for payment flows and external services
- Offline-first architecture with local caching and sync
- Real-time push notifications with FCM
- PDF generation, screenshot capture, and file sharing
- Clean service layer architecture with proper error handling

**System Design & Architecture**
- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms with isolated data models
- Approval workflow engines with state transitions and audit logging
- Billing and payment processing systems with reconciliation
- Account statement generation and financial reporting
- Field operations management with job tracking and evidence capture
- Document generation systems (bills, receipts, statements)
- Integration layers for third-party services

## Engineering Impact

I've architected and delivered systems that power waste service management operations across multiple municipalities, handling:

- **Financial Operations**: Payment processing, automated billing cycles, account reconciliation, and real-time balance tracking
- **Workflow Automation**: Admin desk approval systems with authority-based routing, edit history tracking, and rollback capabilities
- **Data Integrity**: Before/after snapshots for critical operations, comprehensive audit trails, and soft delete recovery
- **User Experience**: Mobile apps with offline capability, real-time sync, push notifications, and intuitive UIs for field workers
- **Operational Efficiency**: Job card management, route optimization, evidence collection, and performance tracking
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Dynamic filtering, export capabilities, and data visualization for decision-making

The systems I build handle high-stakes operations where accuracy, reliability, and traceability are non-negotiable.

## What I Care About as an Engineer

**Production-First Mindset**
I don't just write code that works—I write code that works under pressure. Every feature considers failure modes, data integrity, and user impact.

**Scalability from Day One**
Whether it's optimizing N+1 queries, implementing proper indexing, or designing for horizontal scaling, I think about growth before it becomes a problem.

**Code That Others Maintain**
Clean abstractions, clear naming, comprehensive comments where logic is complex, and documentation that explains the "why" behind architectural decisions.

**Security & Data Protection**
Proper authorization checks, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, secure file handling, and privacy-conscious data management.

**Real-World UX**
Mobile apps that work offline, handle poor network conditions gracefully, provide immediate feedback, and don't crash when users do unexpected things.

## How I Build Production Systems

**Planning Phase**
- Deep understanding of business workflows and edge cases
- Database schema design with normalization and performance in mind
- API contract definition before implementation
- State machine design for complex workflows

**Development Phase**
- Test critical paths (especially financial transactions)
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- API response caching and query optimization
- Migration rollback strategies

**Deployment Phase**
- Database backup verification before schema changes
- Staged rollouts for critical features
- Monitoring error logs and user feedback
- Performance profiling and optimization

**Post-Launch**
- Continuous optimization based on production metrics
- Feature iteration based on real user behavior
- Technical debt management and refactoring
- Documentation updates for team knowledge transfer
